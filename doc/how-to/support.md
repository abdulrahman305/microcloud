# How to get support

We recommend using the following channels for the snaps required to run MicroCloud:

* For MicroCloud: `2/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For LXD: `5.21/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For MicroCeph: `squid/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For MicroOVN: `24.03/(stable|candidate|edge)`

```{note}
The LTS version of MicroCloud is available in the `2` track.
It's recommended to use the `<track>/stable` channels for production deployments.
```
